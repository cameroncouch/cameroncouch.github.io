        <p>After being baffled by the amount of items on screen while paying a bill online, I conceived this a way to combine all third-party widgets, such as chat, help, feedback, along with any other floating UI elements a website may have, such as a "scroll top" or shopping cart button.</p>
        <p>The client can customize a JSON configuration file to control every aspect of the shelf element, like the amount of segments contained within it. The client would also add in the necessary callback functions to launch each respective widget.</p>
        <p>This gives the user the ability to have a less inhibited browsing experience. This is further enabled by enabling the shelf to be draggable to different parts of the viewport.</p>
        <p>Things to improve: Drag & drop responsiveness, fix bugs, refactor JS.</p>

        <h2>Utility for Transformers: The Trading Card Game</h2>
        <h3><span class="bg-span">Built using: </span> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL DB</h3>
        <iframe id="project-tf" src="https://transformers-tcg-dmgctr.herokuapp.com/#!/" title="A tool for use with the Transformers TCG"></iframe>
        <p>This was a personal project that I built as a skills test during my bootcamp experience, and I tied it into my nerdy obsession at the time, playing a trading card game!</p>
        <p>The utility is used as replacement for pen + paper, tokens, or other means of tracking damage dealt through the course of a game of Transformers: The Trading Card Game. It also provides solutions to advanced game mechanics, such as combining cards into one "super-bot" that changes the health value, and the character that is in the playfield.</p>
        <p>Users are also able to get up-to-date pricing on their collection by using the pricing tool, which is powered by the TCG Player REST API.</p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Like many people, my work history begins in retail. I worked for GameStop for +12 years, starting from the ground floor and ending my tenure at the District Manager role. While at GameStop, I earned my bachelors degree in Business, I learned valuable lessons and developed many transferrable skills while leading a great team of people. I also learned how to lead and motivate a team of people with differing personalities at a young age. It was rewarding to positively impact these individual's life.</p>
      <p>You might be saying, "How did you transition from retail to coding?", it's a story worth sharing! While my younger brother was working on his Computer Science degree, and I was leading an $18 million business at GameStop, we worked together on a video game. I did much of the game design, coming up with the story, wireframes for the UI, and all of the art. My brother put together the C# application in Unity, and I came in afterward to make changes to the code by tweaking variables, and copying / pasting objects to create more characters and the like. During that time I became enamored with the idea of coding as a career.</p>
      <p>Some time passed, and in that time I taught myself SQL, and dabbled in the trinity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One day at work, my wife learned through a graduate of the program, about something called "Grand Circus", a coding bootcamp located in the center of downtown Detroit. After a lot of research, planning, and with the support of my wife I charted out my path to becoming a developer. I delayed attending the bootcamp and completed the busy holiday shopping season at GameStop. In the time between, we built up our reserves, knowing that I would be out of work for at least four months.</p>
      <p>My mindset going into the bootcamp was that of incredible focus, passion, and dedication; Not only because I was unemployed, but because I have an extreme motivation to succeed and excel. I was driving an hour or more to Detroit during the winter, and I was excited to be the first one in the building, eager to learn. It was tough on my wife, as I was not home to run errands, do chores, or be there for my partner. I was working 12 hour shifts every day, only to come home and continue reading, studying, and coding until 2AM sometimes!</p>
      <p>The experience was awesome, I learned so much. While my main studies were in learning HTML, CSS, and full-stack JavaScript (Database, Express, Angular, nodejs), I also grew my soft skills by giving peer-to-peer feedback, working in groups to design, pair-code, and troubleshoot, and communicate what value I can bring to an organization during 1:1 sessions with career resources</p>
      <p>While still attending Grand Circus, I received calls from recruiters and had even had my first interview for a developer job, complete with a coding challenge, YIPES! Although I was not a fit for that role, I did find a position shortly after graduating from the full-stack frontend bootcamp at Grand Circus. The position was not in development, but I was working with code (troubleshooting, implementing, editing JSON files, working in the Oracle DB, and working with clients). A little after a year, I was promoted into my current position, on a new team, developing and maintaining tools for the Support team. I'm working on many different applications, with stacks that include JavaScript/TypeScript, nodejs, Angular, React, SQL, and Python.</p>
      <p>In my off-time, I am focused on furthering my understanding of general concepts programming, as well as learning the basics of different languages and their syntax. My goal is to continue to learn and practice in order to become a top-notch full-stack developer, and eventually lead a team of developers.</p>
      <p>I love what I do!</p>
