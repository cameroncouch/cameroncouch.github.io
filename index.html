                A fun weekend project co-developed with my brother for Ludem Dare Game Jam 50 -- with a theme of
                "Inevitable".
              </p>
              <p>This was invigorating working with a theme, and getting to come up with an idea in a very short time
                frame. It also forced me to not succumb to scope creep</p>

        <p>This was a fun one, as I implemented my own gravity, collision, and fun little tricks like transparency and

              I wanted to develop a Gamepad tester that I could use without worrying about some nefarious site dropping cookies and localStorage data on my machine! So I made a Gamepad testing application using the Gamepad API!
            </p>
            <p>Simply plug in a USB controller (Xbox, Playstation, etc.), press a button, and you can start testing</p>
            <p>It also supports testing multiple controllers at once!</p>

              A love-letter to Bandai Namco's DigiMon and Tamagotchi virtual pets, but taking the formula to a
              different
              place. Co-developed with my brother Dave Vader and a small team of University of Michigan CS students.

        <p>After being baffled by the amount of items on screen while paying a bill online, I conceived this a way to
          combine all third-party widgets, such as chat, help, feedback, along with any other floating UI elements a
          website may have, such as a "scroll top" or shopping cart button.</p>
        <p>The client can customize a JSON configuration file to control every aspect of the shelf element, like the
          amount of segments contained within it. The client would also add in the necessary callback functions to
          launch each respective widget.</p>
        <p>This gives the user the ability to have a less inhibited browsing experience. This is further enabled by
          enabling the shelf to be draggable to different parts of the viewport.</p>

              into
              my nerdy obsession at the time, playing a trading card game!
            </p>
            <p>The utility is used as replacement for pen + paper, tokens, or other means of tracking damage dealt
              through
              the course of a game of Transformers: The Trading Card Game. It also provides solutions to advanced game
              mechanics, such as combining cards into one "super-bot" that changes the health value, and the character
              that
              is in the playfield.</p>
            <p>Users are also able to get up-to-date pricing on their collection by using the pricing tool, which is
              powered
              by the TCG Player REST API.</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <section id="my-background">
        <p>What truly fuels me is an unwavering passion for doing impactful work, especially when aligned with areas I
          care deeply about. My lifelong immersion in video games isn't just a hobby; it's a profound influence that
          taught me the power of engagement, problem-solving, and the joy of shared experiences.</p>
        <p>This passion led me to pursue and immerse myself in programming and leadership. Currently, I lead a team of
          JavaScript developers, building bespoke digital analytics solutions for major corporations. My journey, from
          fostering connections while working in retail at GameStop, to independently developing games, has underscored
          the importance of pursuing passions and building strong relationships, which have put me on the path to
          achieving both personal and professional success. I'm always looking for an opportunity to contribute my
          dedicated work ethic and leadership skills to a company in a vertical where my passion can truly shine, making
          a tangible difference for both the business and its people.
