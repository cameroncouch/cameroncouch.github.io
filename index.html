        <h2>Service Shelf</h2>
        <h3><span class="bg-span">B</span>uilt using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON</h3>
        <div id="shelf-container"></div>
        <p>After being baffled by the amount of items on screen while paying a bill online, I conceived this a way to combine all third-party widgets, such as chat, help, feedback, along with any other floating UI elements a website may have, such as a "scroll top" or shopping cart button.</p>
        <p>The client can customize a JSON configuration file to control every aspect of the shelf element, like the amount of segments contained within it. The client would also add in the necessary callback functions to launch each respective widget.</p>
        <p>This gives the user the ability to have a less inhibited browsing experience. This is further enabled by enabling the shelf to be draggable to different parts of the viewport.</p>
        <p>Things to improve: Drag & drop responsiveness, fix bugs, refactor JS.</p>

        <h2>Utility for Transformers: The Trading Card Game</h2>
        <h3><span class="bg-span">Built using: </span> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL DB</h3>
        <iframe id="project-tf" src="https://transformers-tcg-dmgctr.herokuapp.com/#!/" title="A tool for use with the Transformers TCG"></iframe>
        <p>This was a personal project that I built as a skills test during my bootcamp experience, and I tied it into my nerdy obsession at the time, playing a trading card game!</p>
        <p>The utility is used as replacement for pen + paper, tokens, or other means of tracking damage dealt through the course of a game of Transformers: The Trading Card Game. It also provides solutions to advanced game mechanics, such as combining cards into one "super-bot" that changes the health value, and the character that is in the playfield.</p>
        <p>Users are also able to get up-to-date pricing on their collection by using the pricing tool, which is powered by the TCG Player REST API.</p>
        <p>Things to improve: CSS, fix bugs, refactor JS.</p>
