        <p>A fun weekend project co-developed with my brother for Ludem Dare Game Jam 50 -- with a theme of
          "Inevitable".</p>

        <p>My first step into Godot and C++ after reading Stephen Seth Ulibarri's book on C++. Styled after Super Mario
          RPG from Squaresoft</p>
        <p>This was a fun one, as I implemented my own gravity, collision, and fun little tricks like transparency and
          shadows as the character jumps and moves behind blocks! Also this was when Crabboy was born :-)</p>

        <p>A love-letter to Bandai Namco's DigiMon and Tamagotchi virtual pets, but taking the formula to a different
          place. Co-developed with my brother Dave Vader and a small team of University of Michigan CS students.</p>

        <h2>Service Shelf</h2>
        <h3><span class="bg-span">B</span>uilt using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON</h3>
        <div id="shelf-container"></div>
        <p>After being baffled by the amount of items on screen while paying a bill online, I conceived this a way to
          combine all third-party widgets, such as chat, help, feedback, along with any other floating UI elements a
          website may have, such as a "scroll top" or shopping cart button.</p>
        <p>The client can customize a JSON configuration file to control every aspect of the shelf element, like the
          amount of segments contained within it. The client would also add in the necessary callback functions to
          launch each respective widget.</p>
        <p>This gives the user the ability to have a less inhibited browsing experience. This is further enabled by
          enabling the shelf to be draggable to different parts of the viewport.</p>

        <h2>Utility for Transformers: The Trading Card Game</h2>

          <img src="./assets/transformers.png" class="block-image" aria-label="screenshot of transformers web app">
        </div>
        <p>This was a personal project that I built as a skills test during my bootcamp experience, and I tied it into
          my nerdy obsession at the time, playing a trading card game!</p>
        <p>The utility is used as replacement for pen + paper, tokens, or other means of tracking damage dealt through
          the course of a game of Transformers: The Trading Card Game. It also provides solutions to advanced game
          mechanics, such as combining cards into one "super-bot" that changes the health value, and the character that
          is in the playfield.</p>
        <p>Users are also able to get up-to-date pricing on their collection by using the pricing tool, which is powered
          by the TCG Player REST API.</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <section id="my-backgroud">
        <p>What truly fuels me is an unwavering passion for doing impactful work, especially when aligned with areas I
          care deeply about. My lifelong immersion in video games isn't just a hobby; it's a profound influence that
          taught me the power of engagement, problem-solving, and the joy of shared experiences.</p>
        <p>This passion led me to pursue and immerse myself in programming and leadership. Currently, I lead a team of
          JavaScript developers, building bespoke digital analytics solutions for major corporations. My journey, from
          fostering connections while working in retail at GameStop, to independently developing games, has underscored
          the importance of pursuing passions and building strong relationships, which have put me on the path to
          achieving both personal and professional success. I'm always looking for an opportunity to contribute my
          dedicated work ethic and leadership skills to a company in a vertical where my passion can truly shine, making
          a tangible difference for both the business and its people.
